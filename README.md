# SVS_PostHClothingStatePersistence
A mod for SVS
1. Make sure game is up to date with latest [HF Patch](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/SVS-HF_Patch/releases/) and unencrypted metadata.
2. Download the latest release.
3. Extract the release to your game root. The plugin .dll should end up inside your 'BepInEx\plugins' folder. Overwrite if asked.
4. In game, launch the configuration menu (F1) to configure plugin.  You can configure hotkey you press to activate mod, the amount of time in minutes that everyone is naked, and toggle whether you allow changing outfits or not.
5. Nudity will persist from the time you press the hotkey in game, until time configured is up, or until the day period is over, or until hotkey is pressed again.
6. Enjoy!
